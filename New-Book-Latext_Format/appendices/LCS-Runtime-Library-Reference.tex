## *Appendix n - Runtime Library Routines Reference*

// ??? **note** this appendix will not repeat what is documented in the source. This is a battle you cannot win. I have a small utility that takes an augmented C-source include file and makes it a markdown document. 

// ??? **note** we could just include this file, or keep a reference to it for the utility to include. The result of the utility is a markdown file with all the text in this file and the included files, which is then the base for PDF creation.

// ?? **note** have a table with all items... 

| Item | purpose | Get | Put | Req |
