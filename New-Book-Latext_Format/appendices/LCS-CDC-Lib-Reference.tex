## *Appendix n - Controller Dependent Code Library Routines Reference*

// ??? **note** this appendix will not repeat what is documented in the source. This is a battle you cannot win. I have a small utility that takes an augmented C-source include file and makes it a markdown document. 

// ??? **note** we could just include this file, or keep a reference to it for the utility to include. The result of the utility is a markdown file with
// all the text in this file and the included files, which is then the base for PDF creation.
