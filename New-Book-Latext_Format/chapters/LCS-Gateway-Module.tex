## *LCS Module - Gateways*

The layout system rests on the CAN Bus and all nodes connect to the bus. But this is only one way to built the foundation. The requirements to connect a computer can be handled via the USB bus of the base station. But also, as the protocol is not bound to the CAN Bus, there is an option to have a gateway to connect other devices via for example an Ethernet protocol. But right now, this is work on the to do list.

// ??? **note**  need to structure the chapter.

- LCS messages, different HW bus.
- LCS messages sent to a computer via USB or Ethernet
- LCS Messages WLAN
- protocol gateways for protocols such as LocoNet
