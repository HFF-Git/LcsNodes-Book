\chapterr{\textit{Appendix n - Runtime Library Routines Reference}}

// ??? \textbf{note} this appendix will not repeat what is documented in the source. This is a battle you cannot win. I have a small utility that takes an augmented C-source include file and makes it a markdown document. 

// ??? \textbf{note} we could just include this file, or keep a reference to it for the utility to include. The result of the utility is a markdown file with all the text in this file and the included files, which is then the base for PDF creation.

// ?? \textbf{note} have a table with all items...
