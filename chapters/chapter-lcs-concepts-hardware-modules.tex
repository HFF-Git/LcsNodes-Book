\chapter{Hardware Modules}

talk a little about the modules and extensions ...

we will have a main board and extension boards

main board hosts the controller and perhaps special HW that needs to be close to the controller

they will always have the LCS bus interface and a power supply for itself and the extentions

extensions are access via a I2C bus

they implement functions for as sensors and actors

there is a standardized interface connector between main board and extension boards

up to 4 extension boards can be connected to a main board
