\chapter{LCS Module - Gateways}

The layout system rests on the CAN Bus and all nodes connect to the bus. But this is only one way to built the foundation. The requirements to connect a computer can be handled via the USB bus of the base station. But also, as the protocol is not bound to the CAN Bus, there is an option to have a gateway to connect other devices via for example an Ethernet protocol. But right now, this is work on the to do list.

\section{Base Station ASCII Interface}

a kind of gateway

\section{LCS Bus Gateway}

issue LCS messages directly from a computer, etc.

\section{LAN Gateway}

issue LCS messages received via LAN, WLAN

\section{LocoNet Gateway}

protocol gateway

translate LocNet messages into LCS messags
