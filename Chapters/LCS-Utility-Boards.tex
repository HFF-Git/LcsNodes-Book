\section{Adapter PCB}

The adapter PCB is a small board that plugs into the controller board. Its sole purpose is to extend and route connector pins to screw terminals, allowing cables to be easily secured.

\section{Diagnostics}

When developing a new controller board, testing the extension connector pins is essential. Combined with a diagnostic program, the board can be thoroughly tested. This small board plugs into the controller board to facilitate testing.

talk about the diagnostics. perhaps add the diagnostic program to the CDC or runtime library.

\section{BYE - Build your own extension}

It is often necessary to build rapid small prototypes, and this is where this board comes in handy.
BYE is an extension board featuring NVM logic and breadboard-style rows of holes for custom designs.
